# Bean GUI

GUI written in python/tkinter as a wrapper around statistical functions. Work in progress

## Getting started

* base.py
The base script for BEAN.

To run use `python bean_gui/base.py`

**Warning some apple systems may not be able to run base.py due to older tkinter versions being installed. Update tkinter to newer versions**
