# Bean GUI

GUI written in python/tkinter as a wrapper around statistical functions.

## Getting started


* crude_app.py 
This is an experiment in what the gui layout could be. It loads and saves csv, and displays rudimentally info. Located in the dev folder

To run use `python crude_app.py`

* base.py
This is potentially the base script for BEAN.

To run use `python base.py`

**Warning some apple systems may not be able to run base.py due to older tkinter versions being installed. Update tkinter to newer versions**
